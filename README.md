# Chatbot-Link-Extractor
A chatbot that can extract links from the [RURA website](https://rura.rw/index.php?id=23) using web scraping, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or above
- pip
- Virtualenv (recommended)

### Installing

1. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
```
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate

```
for windows:
```
virtualenv env
env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/Chatbot-Link-Extractor.git
```

3. Navigate to develop branch.

3. Install the required packages.

4. Run the chatbot.

## How it works

- The chatbot uses web scraping to extract links and their text from the RURA website using the Beautiful Soup library and the requests library.
- The extracted data is then manipulated and cleaned using the pandas library.
- Intents are generated from the links, and patterns are generated by looking at different ways a user could ask questions to the chatbot.
- A Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) is trained on the intents and patterns using the PyTorch library.
- The chatbot is multilingual and allows a user to enter information in any language, using the Google Language Detect library to detect the language and the Google Translate library to translate to the language used by the user.
